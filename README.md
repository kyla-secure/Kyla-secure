## Hi there 👋
# 👋 Hey there, I'm Kyla

I'm a Fullstack Cybersecurity Bootcmp student and tech enthusiast building modular labs, documenting everything, and optimizing life one subnet at a time.

## 🔧 Skills
- Cisco Packet Tracer, VLANs, DHCP, Subnetting
- Cybersecurity labs with Kali, Metasploitable, and Windows

## 🧠 What I Do
- 🔐 **Cybersecurity Labs**: Virtualized environments with Kali, Windows, and vulnerable targets. Every step validated and snapshot-ready.
- 🌐 **Network Engineering**: Cisco Packet Tracer wizardry—DHCP, VLAN isolation, secure routing, and subnetting that actually makes sense.
- 📊 **Documentation Mastery**: Configs, command outputs, validation matrices, and screenshots—because if it’s not documented, it didn’t happen.

## 🎯 Current Goals
- Earn Security+ and CySA+ certifications  
- Land an entry-level analyst role in Austin, Phoenix, Denver, D.C., or Seattle...  
- Build a portfolio that screams “hire me” before you even scroll
